Source Code Files
=================
 
This section provides an overview of the header files used in the AERtronic Lite project.
Header files in this project contain declarations for functions, macros, constants, and data types
that are shared across multiple source files. They play a crucial role in ensuring modularity
and reusability of code, allowing for a clean separation of interface and implementation.
 
Each header file is designed to serve a specific purpose, such as defining hardware interfaces,
managing configurations, or providing utility functions. Below, you will find detailed
descriptions of each header file, including their purpose and key components.

Function that handles the data received from the Nextion display over the serial port. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em code} & The code that was received from the Nextion display, depends on the command sent \\
\hline
{\em data1} & The data received from the Nextion display, depends on the page number received \\
\hline
{\em data2} & The data received from the Nextion display, depends on the page number received. Defaults to 0x00 if not used.\\
\hline

void serial\+\_\+read (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{void}]{}{}\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Function to read data coming from the serial port. This function is design to handle the data from the display and process it accordingly. 

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The command received has the following format\+: code + data1 + data2.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The code is a single byte that identifies the command.
\item The data1 is a single byte that contains the value associated with the command.
\item The data2 is a single byte that contains additional information related to the command. Defaults to 0x00 if not used.
